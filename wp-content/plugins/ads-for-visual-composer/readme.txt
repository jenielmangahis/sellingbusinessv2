Manage ads in your WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) interface.

== Description ==

This plugin combines the WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) and the [Advanced Ads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/) ad management plugin in order to integrate ads and banners into websites built with that page builder.

Please notice that _WPBakery Page Builder_ is [this plugin on codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431), formerly called Visual Composer.

The Visual Composer plugin as hosted [here](https://visualcomposer.io) is a different product from the same team. In order to use Advanced Ads with that website builder just use the shortcodes coming with Advanced Ads in their _Text Block_.

**Ad Management Features**

Advanced Ads is a powerful, but easy to use ad management plugin. Among the [many features](https://wpadvancedads.com/features/), you can:

* manage all kinds of ads like Google AdSense, Google ad manager, Amazon, Taboola, Tradedoubler, Getyourguide, Booking.com, Ezoic, media.net, Awin and any other custom code
* show ads for mobile/desktop users only
* automatically inject ads into content, e.g. after specific paragraphs, headlines or images
* use Pro visitor conditions like browser width, geo location, browser language and many more
* benefit from dedicated Google AdSense support for all ad types (e.g. AdSense in.feed, AdSense in.article, AdSense Auto ads) 

**Instructions**

After activating this plugin, as well as WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) and Advanced Ads, you should find three new WPBakery Page Builder elements in the editor:

* Advanced Ads – Ad
* Advanced Ads – Group
* Advanced Ads – Placement

Each of them corresponds to the according element in Advanced Ads. You only need to enter the ids/slug of that element to show it in Visual Composer.

All elements are also grouped into the _Ads_ tab.

**Where to find the IDs?**

Ads: Open the ad edit screen and stop the Wizard, if active. You should now see the Ad Id below the ad title.
Groups: The Group ID is listed in the Details column of the ad group list.
Placement: Create a _Manual_ placement. Open the list of placements and click on _show usage_ below the placement’s name. Extract the ID from the id attribute in the shortcode field
